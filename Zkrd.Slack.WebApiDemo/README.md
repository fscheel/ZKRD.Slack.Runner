# ZKRD Slack bot Web API demo

This is the demo project on how to implement a web API endpoint for the ZKRD Slack bot. These endpoints are generated by
the [`FastEnpoints` library](https://fast-endpoints.com/index.html).

Implementing an endpoint is done by creating request and response objects and one or more endpoint classes extending
the `FastEndpoints.Endpoint` class. These endpoint classes are then autmoatically picked up at runtime without the need
to register them to the dependency injection container.
